# Sensor Data Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect anomalies in sensor data using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises sensor readings collected over time, and the goal is to identify deviations from normal patterns that may indicate potential issues or anomalies.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Modeling:** Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as [list algorithms you used, e.g., Random Forest, Isolation Forest, etc.] for anomaly detection.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations of sensor data, anomalies detected, and model performance metrics.
